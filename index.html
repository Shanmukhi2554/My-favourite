    <p>My favorite hobby is to read interesting and informative books in my spare time. Whenever I go home from school, I like to read books like this after completing my homework. I am 12 years old and study in class 7. Now, I know very well that reading books is a very good habit, which makes me complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however, I have found it naturally. Reading books keeps a person happy and busy. It is a good source of joy, knowledge, encouragement and information. It makes us disciplined, just, reliable, punctual and more importantly a successful person.</p>
